Level 1 (One question is compulsory)
1. Create a Cairo function named sum_multiples that takes two parameters, n and m, both of
type u32. The function should calculate and return the sum of all numbers from 1 to n that are
multiples of m. Test the function with different values of n and m. (5 mks)
2. Create a Cairo function named find_primes that takes an integer n as input and prints all
prime numbers less than or equal to n. Test the function with different values of n. (5 mks)
Level 2 (One question is compulsory)
1. Create a Cairo function called print_odd_multiples that takes two parameters, n and m,
both of type u32. The function should print all odd multiples of m less than or equal to n. Test
the function with different values of n and m. (5 mks)
2. Write a function named is_prime that takes an integer n as input and returns true if n is a
prime number, and false otherwise. Test the function with different values of n. (5 mks)
Level 3 (One question is compulsory)
1. Create a Cairo function called calculate_power that takes two parameters, base and
exponent, both of type u32. The function should calculate and return the result of
base^exponent. Test the function with different values of base and exponent. (5 mks)
2. Write a Cairo function called print_odd_numbers that takes an integer n as inp
