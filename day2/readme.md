Questions
LEVEL 1
• Write a Cairo function that takes an integer num as input and returns its square
• The following is a code snippet that was written by a Cairo Student.
use debug::PrintTrait;
fn main() {
let x = 5;
x.print();
x = 6;
x.print();
}
1. Copy the Code into a Cairo file and run it. What error do you notice?
2. Fix the error you notice
LEVEL 2
• 2.1) Implement a Cairo function called calculatePower that takes two arguments, base
(type felt252) and exponent (type u32), and returns the result of raising base to the
power of exponent.
• 1.1) Write a Cairo function called calculateRectanglePerimeter that takes two
arguments, length (type u32) and width (type u32), and returns the perimeter of a
rectangle (type felt252).
LEVEL 3
• The following is a code written by documentors in the starknet book
fn main() {
let tup = (500, 6, 8, 12);
}
Complete the Code above hence making it add the values in the tuple and printing the sum
•
Extend the code snippet by converting the answer you get to a u256 and printing it again
