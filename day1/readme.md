I answered these questions briefly more content I will add once I start deploy things on the testnet

LEVEL1
What is Cairo designed for, and what makes its processor unique?
How does Cairo's virtual CPU handle cryptographic constraints, and what advantage does this offer?

LEVEL2
What is Starknet, and what technologies does it leverage for scalability, privacy, and security?
How does Starknet function as a Layer-2 scalability solution for Ethereum, and what cryptographic systems does it use to reduce computation costs?

LEVEL 3
What is Starkware, and what has been its key innovations in the blockchain industry?
How does StarkEx leverage STARK proofs to ensure the validity of large batches of transactions off-chain with a minimal on-chain footprint?
