//Cairo Syntax and Data types

Cairo syntax looks similara like that of rust for instance in varibale declaration
while declaring varibale we fullcolon to separate it with its type.
Just like rust we have the unsigned integers ranging fro u8 to u256 but then there is this
datatype which is felt252 which a variable declared is cairo and not assigned its type is assigned to felt252.
felt252 is not similar as unsigned integers and one has to use the into and
