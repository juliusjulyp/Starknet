//Cairo Syntax and Data types

Cairo syntax looks similar like that of rust for instance in varibale declaration but there is a little catch in cairo and
I see it as interesting can't wait to get rocking.
while declaring varibale we use fullcolon to separate it with its type. And by default if felt252 is always going to be assigned.
Just like rust we have the unsigned integers ranging fro u8 to u256 but then there is this
datatype which is felt252, which a variable declared is cairo and not assigned its type is assigned to felt252.
felt252 is not similar as unsigned integers.
But regarding not being the same we can still convert it other types like u8 all the way to u256, How??
Just by the use of (traits::Into) && (traits::TryInto) and it can be done vice versa.
All thanks to cairo!!
Cairo also allows us to use stucts and enums to create different types
